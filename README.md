Spackle
================

While .NET is vast and rich in features, it can't do everything. Spackle.NET is a collection of extension methods and utility classes that "fill in the holes" in .NET. 

Why did I use "spackle"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfilla :)

Spackle is now available through NuGet - search for the term "Spackle".
